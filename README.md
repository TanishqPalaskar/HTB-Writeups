# Hack The Box Write-Ups

Welcome to my collection of Hack The Box (HTB) write-ups! This repository contains detailed write-ups for various HTB machines that I've worked on as part of my cybersecurity studies and practice.

## About

Hack The Box is an online platform that provides a variety of virtual machines and challenges for cybersecurity enthusiasts to practice their skills. Each machine or challenge on HTB presents unique security issues and vulnerabilities to explore and exploit.

## Repository Structure
